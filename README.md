# DRV3-Tools

PLEASE NOTE: These programs are still in an "alpha" stage, so some functions may not work as intended
(but even if they do, they might still break things). Therefore, please make sure to
keep backups of all your game files and expect many game crashes.

To extract the game data from the CPK archives, I recommend my modified fork of CriPakGUI,
which can be found here (you'll probably want the x64 version):
https://github.com/jpmac26/CriPakTools/releases

I am not very good at reverse-engineering, so if anyone knows how to improve these tools,
I would greatly appreciate any assistance!

# DRV3-Tools

PLEASE NOTE: I am not very good at reverse-engineering, and so these programs are unfinished and not all of the functions currently work as intended (or they do work as intended, but they still break things). As such, please make sure to keep backups of all your game files and expect many game crashes.

Currently the only things that are known to work are the SPC unpacking (not re-packing), and the STX Editor. To re-insert the modified STX files, you will need to manually replace the data in the original SPC file using a hex editor, alter the data header to indicate that it's no longer compressed, and change the relevant compressed & uncompressed size values. I will post a tutorial on how to do this later, but for now enjoy these tools, and if anyone knows how to improve them, I would greatly appreciate any assistance!
